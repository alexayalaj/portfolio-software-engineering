# 🚀 **Software Engineering Portfolio**

Welcome to my portfolio as a **Software Development Engineering** student.

This repository showcases projects developed in **Python** and **R**, covering programming fundamentals, data structures, file handling, applied statistics, and interactive console solutions.

Alongside my academic training, I currently work in the **Salesforce ecosystem**, where I build integrations, automations, and technical architectures—combining hands-on cloud experience with solid software engineering foundations.

## 🐍 **Python Projects**

### 🧮 **Pythagoras Table**

Generation of a multiplication table without the `*` operator—using successive addition to demonstrate basic logic, modularity, and pure functions.

---

### 🧩 **Tuples, Dictionaries, Exceptions & Strings**

Interactive console program demonstrating:

- Data structures
- Input validation
- Custom exceptions
- String manipulation
- Functional programming patterns

Great for reinforcing core programming fundamentals.

---

### 🗂️ **Attendance System – Phase II**

A full interactive console system integrating:

- Matrix-style menu
- File reading and writing
- Date capture and validation
- Custom exception handling
- User session management
- Loading animation
- Modular program architecture

This is one of the most complete and polished projects in the portfolio.

---

## 📊 **R Statistics Projects**

### 📉 **Central Tendency & Combinatorics**

Computation of statistical measures, frequency tables, and combinatorics exercises using base R.

---

### 📈 **Food Delight – Confidence Intervals**

Comparative analysis of two delivery methods, including:

- Means and variances
- Standard error
- 95% confidence interval
- Two-tailed hypothesis test
- Executive interpretation of results

---

## 🧠 **Technologies Used**

- Python 3
- R Base
- Git / GitHub
- VS Code
- Programming logic
- Applied statistics
